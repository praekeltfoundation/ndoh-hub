Deployment Notes

---

Check that field "endline_airtime_received" exists on production

---

Things Fritz still need to figure out / implement

---

*Content Repo*
- Check the content repo stuff and list what still needs to be updated there


*RapidPro*
- Beta participants and how and where they need to be excluded
- Inbound message of type media, we need to store it and label it? (Road to Health booklet)
- We need to be able to share these participant MSISDN's with IDI so that they can call the endline participants. So when we send out these notifications, we need to somehow save these numbers to a group or something, and then share those on a daily/weekly basis with IDI.
- Switching people back to core, and where to slot them in based on baby dob
- Mechanism for handling people that did not receive airtime and sent back the keyword "airtime"
- For those that were in beta or recruited before 9/5, we put them in a flow with an end of study msg and then switch them to core - same week as would have been the endline notification etc.
- List of peeps that we need to send IDI (or include a list of peeps they send us??) as discussed by Kris with them yesterday, I am completely lost in terms of what I need to do
